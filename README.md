# ShutterBuddy

A app that enables users to select popular sightseeing locations by cities and to choose photos of the landmarks that are available to be shared under Creative Commons licensing.

The idea for the app stemmed from personal experience of the frustration of losing vacation photos due to camera malfunctions. There are a variety of applications for ShutterBuddy. It can be used to assist in planning the itinerary of an upcoming trip by identifying potential items to visit, as a means for helping people “see the sights” if they are otherwise unable to travel, or in helping determine which landmarks you want to give priority to if you are on a constricted timeline.
To be user friendly, the app does not require a login. Users are able to enter a city and then, from a list populated by the Google Places API, select landmarks with the option of specifying weather or time of day to customize their search. If a particular landmark is not included on the list, users can manually add the desired landmark to the search.

Drawing from Flickr’s API, ShutterBuddy provides a selection of photos that have been tagged with the preferred search terms. The user can select the photos they like and ShutterBuddy will provide a link to share with family and friends.
